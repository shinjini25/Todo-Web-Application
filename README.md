# Todo-Web-Application
A simple to do web application made using Node, Express and Mongoose. User can add tasks and check off the tasks once done (which then automatically gets removed from the database and the user is redirected to the home page). There is a default list of 3 tasks that get displayed if all the existing tasks have been checked off.   

How to run in your computer-

1. Cd over to the main working directory and run npm install in the terminal. (installs the required packages mentioned in package.json) This should install the folder node_modules.
2. Head over to http://localhost:3000/ to see the website.
